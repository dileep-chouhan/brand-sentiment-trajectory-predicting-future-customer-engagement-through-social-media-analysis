# Brand Sentiment Trajectory: Predicting Future Customer Engagement through Social Media Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the evolution of social media sentiment towards [Brand Name] to identify key sentiment shifts and predict future customer engagement levels.  The analysis utilizes a time series approach to track sentiment over time, allowing for the identification of trends and potential turning points in customer perception. This information can be valuable for proactive brand management and strategic decision-making.  The project involves data collection, sentiment analysis, time series modeling, and visualization of the results.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify other relevant ML libraries if used)
* Tweepy (or specify other relevant social media API library if used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:
